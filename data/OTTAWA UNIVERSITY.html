This change provides clarification and permits the institution to decide the types of evidence it uses to ensure faculty sufficiency.
              IAC also concurred with the site-visit team that Core Components 4.A and 4.B are Met with Concerns. IAC required that the interim monitoring be embedded in the institution's mid-cycle review rather than hosting a focused visit in September 2026. The change provides more time for the institution to improve its program review and assessment practices and permits the institution to gather sufficient evidence of its effectiveness and to take appropriate actions before the next review.</td>

      <h2 class="section">About HLC and Accreditation</h2>
      <p class="basic">HLC is an institutional accreditation agency that accredits degree-granting colleges and universities that are based in the United States.</p>
      <p class="basic">Institutional accreditation validates the quality of an institution as a whole and evaluates multiple aspects of an institution, including its academic offerings, governance and administration, mission, finances, and resources. HLC's accreditation includes all degree levels as well as on-site and online course delivery. Institutions of higher education in the United States may also seek accreditation through specialized or programmatic accreditation agencies, which accredit programs, departments or schools within a college or university.</p>
      <h3 style="color: #000000; font-weight: 300; font-size: 30px; margin: 20px 0 10px 0;">Evaluation Process</h3>
      <p class="basic">Institutions that HLC accredits are evaluated against its <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Policies/criteria-and-core-components.html" target="_blank">Criteria for Accreditation</a> and other <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Accreditation/hlc-requirements.html" target="_blank">HLC requirements</a>. HLC accreditation assures quality by verifying that an institution (1) meets threshold requirements and (2) is engaged in continuous improvement. In addition, all institutions are required to report data annually in the <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Accreditation/institutional-update.html" target="_blank">Institutional Update</a>, undergo annual monitoring of <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Accreditation/indicators.html" target="_blank">financial and non-financial indicators</a>, and adhere to HLC policies and practices.</p>
      <p class="basic">The accreditation process is based on a system of <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Peer-Review/peer-reviewers.html" target="_blank">peer review</a>. Faculty and staff from institutions of higher education serve as HLC peer reviewers conducting accreditation evaluations for other institutions. They make recommendations to HLCâ€™s decision-making bodies, which take final action on institutional evaluations. </p>
      <h3 style="color: #000000; font-weight: 300; font-size: 30px; margin: 20px 0 10px 0;">Decision Making</h3>
      <p class="basic">HLC's decision-making bodies evaluate and make decisions, called actions, on recommendations from peer reviewers and staff that review institutions for their compliance with HLC's Criteria for Accreditation and other requirements. The decision-making bodies are comprised of institutional representatives and public members. See <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Accreditation/decision-making.html" target="_blank">Decision-Making Bodies and Processes</a> for more information. </p>
      <h3 style="color: #000000; font-weight: 300; font-size: 30px; margin: 20px 0 10px 0;">Public Information</h3>
      <p class="basic">HLC is committed to providing information to the public regarding accreditation decisions made regarding individual institutions.</p>
      <p class="basic">Actions that are taken by HLC regarding an institution's accreditation status are disclosed to the public. In cases of reaffirming continued accreditation, placing an institution on or reviewing a sanction, or withdrawing accreditation, the Action Letter issued to the institution is made available on the institution's Statement of Accreditation Status, found by searching the institution's name through HLC's online directory. Public Disclosure Notices (PDNs) are also issued and posted in the directory in cases of sanction, assigning or removing an institutional designation, resignation of accreditation or candidacy, institutional closing or withdrawal of accreditation by HLC. The PDN provides the public with the most applicable information from the posted Action Letter. HLC decision-making outcomes also are summarized on the <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Students-Communities/recent-actions.html" target="_blank">HLC Institutional Actions page</a>. </p>
      <h3 style="color: #000000; font-weight: 300; font-size: 30px; margin: 20px 0 10px 0;">Complaints Against Institutions</h3>
      <p class="basic">HLC has a formal complaint process, consisting of an <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Students-Communities/complaints.html" target="_blank">online complaint form</a> for faculty, students and other parties to submit information regarding a member institutionâ€™s potential non-compliance with HLC requirements. As stated in <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Policies/complaints-and-other-information-regarding-institutions.html" target="_blank">HLC policy</a>, the complaints process is designed to enable HLC to review, in a timely and fair manner, information that suggests potential substantive non-compliance with an institution's ability to meet HLC requirements. </p>
