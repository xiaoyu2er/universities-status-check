              <p>The H-1B program allows companies and other employers in the United States to temporarily employ foreign workers in occupations that require the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor’s degree or higher in the specific specialty, or its equivalent. H-1B specialty occupations may include fields such as architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, theology, and the arts.

                <div class="accordion__panel">
                  <p>We use the information provided during the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b760e97-882e-421c-8be9-a7e505ffa966" href="/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models/h-1b-electronic-registration-process">electronic registration process</a> to help us determine if a petition is subject to the congressionally mandated cap of 65,000 H-1B visas (commonly known as the “regular cap”) or the advanced degree exemption. The advanced degree exemption is an exemption from the H-1B cap for beneficiaries who have earned a U.S. master’s degree or higher and is available until the number of beneficiaries who are exempt on this basis exceeds 20,000.</p>
                  <p>Congress set the current annual regular cap for the H-1B category at 65,000. Not all H-1B nonimmigrant visas (or status grants) are subject to this annual cap. Please note that up to 6,800 visas are set aside from the 65,000 each fiscal year for the H-1B1 program under the terms of the legislation implementing the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore free trade agreements. Unused visas in this group become available for H-1B use for the next fiscal year’s regular H-1B cap.</p>
                  <p>H-1B workers performing labor or services in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Guam may also be exempt from the H-1B cap (see the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA), Public Law 110-229). H-1B workers in Guam and the CNMI are exempt from the H-1B cap if their employers file the petition before Dec. 31, 2029.</p>

                  <p>H-1B cap-subject petitions, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption, may not be filed unless based on a valid and selected registration for the beneficiary named in the petition (unless the registration requirement is suspended).</p>
                  <p>You may file an H-1B petition no more than six months before the employment start date requested for the beneficiary. The specific filing period and filing location for your petition will be located on your H-1B Registration Selection Notice or on the USCIS website in the event the registration requirement is suspended.</p>

This may include a copy of the signed, certified LCA.

If the LCA was previously submitted in a petition that has been approved, you must submit a list including the name and USCIS case receipt number of any foreign worker who has previously used the LCA. You may not use an LCA for more workers than specified in Part B, Question 7 of the LCA.</p>

                  <p>You must submit evidence of the beneficiary’s education credentials (with English translations when applicable) at the time you file your petition.

                  <p>In addition to the base filing fee, you may need to pay one of the following fees for a petition subject to the cap:</p>
                  <p><strong>American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA) fee:</strong></p>

                  <p>If you filed an H-1B cap petition in a timely manner, but received notification from the delivery service that suggests that there may be a delay or damage to the package or that the package was misrouted, you may file a second H-1B petition with a new fee payment during the designated 90-day filing window on your Registration Selection Notice and the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>An explanation as to why a second petition is being filed, with supporting evidence, such as the notice from the delivery service; and</li>
                    <li>A request to withdraw the first petition filed for the H-1B cap.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If you do not include these items, you will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. USCIS will deny or revoke multiple or duplicative petitions filed by the same petitioner, for the same H-1B worker in the same fiscal year, and will not refund the filing fees.</p>
                  <p>If you properly file a second H-1B petition and withdraw the first, USCIS will withdraw the first petition and proceed with adjudication of the second petition.</p>
                  <p>When we receive a timely and properly filed H-1B cap subject petition, the petitioner (and, if applicable, the petitioner’s legal representative) will be provided a Form I-797, Notice of Action, communicating receipt of the petition. Due to increased filing volumes typically seen during H-1B cap filing periods, there are instances where a petition is timely and properly filed, but issuance of the Form I-797 is delayed. If a petitioner has confirmation from the delivery service that the petition was delivered, but they have not yet received a Form I-797 confirming receipt of the petition, the petitioner should not submit a second petition. If a petitioner has confirmation from the delivery service that the petition was delivered, and they submit a second petition, the petitioner will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. This will result in the denial or revocation of both petitions.</p>
