              <h2>The H-1B Program</h2>
              <p>The H-1B program allows companies and other employers in the United States to temporarily employ foreign workers in occupations that require the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor’s degree or higher in a directly related specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States. H-1B specialty occupations may include fields such as architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, theology, and the arts. For more information about the H-1B program,, visit our <a href="/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7aa010b0-d160-4017-8647-98ee7a86393a" data-entity-substitution="canonical">H-1B Specialty Occupations</a> webpage.</p>

                <div class="accordion__panel">
                  <p>We use the information provided during the <a href="/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-electronic-registration-process" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b760e97-882e-421c-8be9-a7e505ffa966" data-entity-substitution="canonical">electronic registration process</a> to help us determine if a petition is subject to the congressionally mandated cap of 65,000 H-1B visas (commonly known as the “regular cap”) or the advanced degree exemption. The advanced degree exemption is an exemption from the H-1B cap for beneficiaries who have earned a U.S. master’s degree or higher and is available until the number of beneficiaries who are exempt on this basis exceeds 20,000.</p>
                  <p>Congress set the current annual regular cap for the H-1B category at 65,000. Please note that up to 6,800 visas are set aside from the 65,000 each fiscal year for the H-1B1 program under the terms of the legislation implementing the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore free trade agreements. Unused visas in this group become available for H-1B use for the next fiscal year’s regular H-1B cap.</p>
                  <p>Not all H-1B nonimmigrant visas (or status grants) are subject to this annual cap (for example, petitions filed by U.S. institutions of higher education are cap exempt). H-1B workers performing labor or services in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Guam may also be exempt from the H-1B cap (see the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA), Public Law 110-229). H-1B workers in Guam and the CNMI are exempt from the H-1B cap if their employers file the petition before Dec. 31, 2029.&nbsp;</p>

                <div class="accordion__panel">
                  <p>H-1B cap-subject petitions, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption, may not be filed unless based on a valid and selected registration for the beneficiary named in the petition (unless the registration requirement is suspended).</p>
                  <p>You may file an H-1B petition no more than 6 months before the employment start date requested for the beneficiary. On April 1, USCIS will begin accepting online filing for H-1B cap petitions and associated Forms I-907 for petitioners whose registrations have been selected.</p>
                  <p>Petitioners also have the option of filing a paper Form I-129 H-1B petition and any associated Form I-907 if they prefer. However, users will not be able to link paper-filed Forms I-129 and I-907 to their online accounts. For paper-filed forms, you must file the petition at the correct location.

                    <li>You must indicate a start date of Oct. 1 or later (of the applicable fiscal year, and 6 months or less from the receipt date of the petition) on your petition or your petition will be rejected or denied.</li>
                    <li>You must provide a copy of the H-1B Registration Selection Notice for the registration filed by your organization on behalf of the beneficiary with the petition.

                    <li>You must submit evidence of the beneficiary’s passport or travel document used at the time of registration to identify the beneficiary. If the passport or travel document expires between when a registration is submitted and when the H-1B petition is filed, the petitioner should follow the form instructions regarding which passport information should be entered on Page 3, Part 3 of <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker</a>. In support of the H-1B petition, the petitioner should provide documentation for both passports or travel documents to establish that the passport or travel document was valid at the time of registration and an explanation as to why there was a change in identifying information.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that any information provided during the electronic registration process matches the information provided on the petition. If any information does not match, you should provide an explanation with your petition and supporting documentation as to why there was a change or why the information does not match. If information on the registration and petition does not match, USCIS may reject or deny the petition. USCIS encourages the use of a brightly colored coversheet flagging the issue to ensure that this is reviewed upon receipt.</li>
                    <li>Make sure each form is properly signed.

                  <p><strong>Labor Condition Application (LCA)</strong></p>
                  <p>When filing your H-1B petition with USCIS, you must include evidence that an LCA (ETA 9035) has been certified by the U.S. Department of Labor. This may include a copy of the signed, certified LCA. (Note: USCIS encourages petitioners to keep Department of Labor LCA processing times in mind when preparing the H-1B petition and to plan accordingly.) If the LCA was previously submitted in a petition that has been approved, you must submit a list including the name and USCIS case receipt number of any foreign worker who has previously used the LCA. You may not use an LCA for more workers than specified in Part B, Question 7 of the LCA.</p>
                  <p>Please see the Department of Labor’s <a href="https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/">Office of Foreign Labor Certification</a> website for more information on the LCA process.</p>
                  <p><strong>Evidence of Beneficiary’s Educational Background</strong></p>
                  <p>You must submit evidence of the beneficiary’s education credentials (with English translations when applicable) at the time you file your petition. If the beneficiary has met all of the requirements for a degree, but the degree has not yet been awarded, you may submit the following alternate evidence:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A copy of the beneficiary’s final transcript; or</li>
                    <li>A letter from the registrar confirming that the beneficiary has met all of the degree requirements. If the educational institution does not have a registrar, then the letter must be signed by the person in charge of educational records where the degree will be awarded.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If you indicate that the beneficiary is qualified based on a combination of education and experience, please provide substantiating evidence at the time you file your petition.</p>
                  <p><strong>Evidence of Bona Fide Position</strong></p>
                  <p>You must submit evidence that you have a bona fide position in a specialty occupation available for the beneficiary as of the start date of the validity period requested on the petition. You are not required to establish specific day-to-day assignments for the entire time period requested in the petition.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Complete all required sections of the form accurately and in accordance with the regulations and form instructions.</li>
                    <li>H-1B cap petitions and advanced degree exemption petitions for the FY 2026 cap must include an employment start date of no earlier than Oct. 1, 2025. You must indicate a start date of Oct. 1, 2025, or later (and 6 months or less from the receipt date of the petition) on your petition or your petition will be rejected or denied. Do not file petitions earlier than 6 months before the requested employment start date. We will reject H-1B petitions requesting a start date of “As Soon As Possible” or “ASAP.”&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Ensure that you have entered the “Beneficiary Confirmation Number” on the H Classification Supplement.</li>

                    <li>You must include the beneficiary’s passport or travel document number, country of issuance, and expiration date on the Form I-129. The passport or travel document information helps USCIS to confirm that the beneficiary named in the registration notice is the same individual as the beneficiary named in the petition and avoid processing delays.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Ensure that the beneficiary’s name is spelled properly and that their date of birth is displayed in the proper format (mm/dd/yyyy). Also, review the country of birth and citizenship and the I-94 number (if applicable) for accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that any information provided during the electronic registration process matches the information provided on the petition. If information between the registration and petition does not match, the petition may be rejected or denied. If any information does not match, you should provide a written explanation and supporting documentation as to why there was a change or why the information does not match.</li>
                    <li>If the beneficiary is seeking an extension of stay, amendment of stay,&nbsp;or change of status, the petition must include evidence (such as a Form I-94 or Form I-797 approval notice) to establish that the beneficiary will have maintained a valid nonimmigrant status through the employment start date being requested.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Include a copy of the beneficiary’s valid passport or travel document.</li>

                  <p>If you filed an H-1B cap petition in a timely manner, but received notification from the delivery service that suggests that there may be a delay or damage to the package or that the package was misrouted, you may file a second H-1B petition with a new fee payment during the designated 90-day filing window on your Registration Selection Notice and the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>An explanation as to why a second petition is being filed, with supporting evidence, such as the notice from the delivery service; and</li>
                    <li>A request to withdraw the first petition filed for the H-1B cap.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If you do not include these items, you will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. We may deny or revoke multiple or duplicative petitions filed by the same petitioner, for the same H-1B worker in the same fiscal year, and will not refund the filing fees.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>If you properly file a second H-1B petition and withdraw the first, we will withdraw the first petition and proceed with adjudication of the second petition.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>When we receive a timely and properly filed H-1B cap subject petition, the petitioner (and, if applicable, the petitioner’s legal representative) will be provided a Form I-797, Notice of Action, communicating receipt of the petition. Due to increased filing volumes typically seen during H-1B cap filing periods, there are instances where a petition is timely and properly filed, but issuance of the Form I-797 is delayed. If a petitioner has confirmation from the delivery service that the petition was delivered, but they have not yet received a Form I-797 confirming receipt of the petition, the petitioner should not submit a second petition. If a petitioner has confirmation from the delivery service that the petition was delivered, and they submit a second petition, the petitioner will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. This will result in the denial or revocation of both petitions.</p>
