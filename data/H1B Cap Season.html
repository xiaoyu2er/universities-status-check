The advanced degree exemption is an exemption from the H-1B cap for beneficiaries who have earned a U.S. master’s degree or higher and is available until the number of beneficiaries who are exempt on this basis exceeds 20,000.</p>
                  <p>Congress set the current annual regular cap for the H-1B category at 65,000. Not all H-1B nonimmigrant visas (or status grants) are subject to this annual cap. Please note that up to 6,800 visas are set aside from the 65,000 each fiscal year for the H-1B1 program under the terms of the legislation implementing the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore free trade agreements. Unused visas in this group become available for H-1B use for the next fiscal year’s regular H-1B cap.</p>
                  <p>H-1B workers performing labor or services in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Guam may also be exempt from the H-1B cap (see the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA), Public Law 110-229). H-1B workers in Guam and the CNMI are exempt from the H-1B cap if their employers file the petition before Dec. 31, 2029.</p>

                  <p>You may file an H-1B petition no more than 6 months before the employment start date requested for the beneficiary. On April 1, USCIS will begin accepting online filing for H-1B cap petitions and associated Forms I-907 for petitioners whose registrations have been selected.</p>

                  <p>When filing your H-1B petition with USCIS, you must include evidence that an LCA (ETA 9035) has been certified by the U.S. Department of Labor. This may include a copy of the signed, certified LCA. (Note: USCIS encourages petitioners to keep Department of Labor LCA processing times in mind when preparing the H-1B petition and to plan accordingly.) If the LCA was previously submitted in a petition that has been approved, you must submit a list including the name and USCIS case receipt number of any foreign worker who has previously used the LCA. You may not use an LCA for more workers than specified in Part B, Question 7 of the LCA.</p>

                  <p>The U.S. Department of Treasury has approved a temporary increase in the daily credit card transaction limit from $24,999.99 to $99,999.99 per day for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted <strong>online</strong> using one credit card for the FY 2025 H-1B cap season.&nbsp;This temporary increase is in response to stakeholder feedback and the volume of previous H-1B registrations that exceeded the daily credit card limit.</p>
                  <p><strong>Checks</strong></p>
                  <p>Check must be:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Payable to the Department of Homeland Security;</li>
                    <li>Include the proper amount and signature.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We prefer that you submit a separate check for each fee. For example, if you are required to pay the base filing fee, the fraud fee, and the ACWIA fee, you should submit three separate checks. If you only submit one check as combined payment for all applicable fees and certain fees do not apply or are incorrect, we will reject your H-1B petition.</p>
                  <p><strong>Money Orders</strong></p>
                  <p>Money orders must be properly endorsed.</p>
                  <p><strong>Incorrect Filing Fee</strong></p>
                  <p>We will reject all petitions submitted with the incorrect filing fee.</p>

                  <p>As a reminder,&nbsp;USCIS recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-announces-inflation-adjustment-to-premium-processing-fees">announced</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/28/2023-28529/adjustment-to-premium-processing-fees">final rule</a>&nbsp;that will increase the filing fee for Form I-907, to adjust for inflation, effective Feb. 26, 2024. If USCIS receives a Form I-907 postmarked on or after Feb. 26, 2024, with the incorrect filing fee, we will reject the Form I-907 and return the filing fee. For filings sent by commercial courier (such as UPS, FedEx, and DHL), the postmark date is the date reflected on the courier receipt.</p>

                    <li>Complete all required sections of the form accurately and in accordance with the regulations and form instructions.</li>
                    <li>H-1B cap petitions and advanced degree exemption petitions for the FY 2025&nbsp;cap must include an employment start date of no earlier than Oct. 1, 2024. You must indicate a start date of Oct. 1, 2024&nbsp;or later (and 6 months or less from the receipt date of the petition) on your petition or your petition will be rejected or denied. Do not file petitions earlier than 6 months before the requested employment start date. We will reject H-1B petitions requesting a start date of “As Soon As Possible” or “ASAP.”</li>
                    <li>Ensure that you have entered the “Beneficiary Confirmation Number” on the H Classification Supplement.</li>

                    <li>You must include the beneficiary’s passport or travel document number, country of issuance, and expiration date on the Form I-129.

                    <li>Ensure that the beneficiary’s name is spelled properly and that their date of birth is displayed in the proper format (mm/dd/yyyy). Also, review the country of birth and citizenship and the I-94 number (if applicable) for accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that any information provided during the electronic registration process matches the information provided on the petition. If information between the registration and petition does not match, the petition may be rejected or denied. If any information does not match, you should provide a written explanation and supporting documentation as to why there was a change or why the information does not match.</li>
                    <li>If the beneficiary is seeking an extension of stay or change of status, the petition should include evidence (such as a Form I-94 or Form I-797 approval notice) to establish that the beneficiary will have maintained a valid nonimmigrant status through the employment start date being requested.</li>
                    <li>Include a copy of the beneficiary’s valid passport or travel document.</li>

                <div class="accordion__panel">
                  <p>If you filed an H-1B cap petition in a timely manner, but received notification from the delivery service that suggests that there may be a delay or damage to the package or that the package was misrouted, you may file a second H-1B petition with a new fee payment during the designated 90-day filing window on your Registration Selection Notice and the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>An explanation as to why a second petition is being filed, with supporting evidence, such as the notice from the delivery service; and</li>
                    <li>A request to withdraw the first petition filed for the H-1B cap.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If you do not include these items, you will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. USCIS may deny or revoke multiple or duplicative petitions filed by the same petitioner, for the same H-1B worker in the same fiscal year, and will not refund the filing fees.</p>
                  <p>If you properly file a second H-1B petition and withdraw the first, USCIS will withdraw the first petition and proceed with adjudication of the second petition.</p>
                  <p>When we receive a timely and properly filed H-1B cap subject petition, the petitioner (and, if applicable, the petitioner’s legal representative) will be provided a Form I-797, Notice of Action, communicating receipt of the petition. Due to increased filing volumes typically seen during H-1B cap filing periods, there are instances where a petition is timely and properly filed, but issuance of the Form I-797 is delayed. If a petitioner has confirmation from the delivery service that the petition was delivered, but they have not yet received a Form I-797 confirming receipt of the petition, the petitioner should not submit a second petition. If a petitioner has confirmation from the delivery service that the petition was delivered, and they submit a second petition, the petitioner will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. This will result in the denial or revocation of both petitions.</p>
