      <h2 class="section">About HLC and Accreditation</h2>
      <p class="basic">The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) is an institutional accreditation agency that accredits degree-granting colleges and universities that are based in the United States.</p>
      <p class="basic">Institutional accreditation validates the quality of an institution as a whole and evaluates multiple aspects of an institution, including its academic offerings, governance and administration, mission, finances, and resources. HLC’s accreditation includes all degree levels as well as onsite and online course delivery. Institutions of higher education in the United States may also seek accreditation through specialized or programmatic accreditation agencies, which accredit programs, departments or schools within a college or university.</p>
      <p class="basic">Institutions that HLC accredits are evaluated against its <a href="/Policies/criteria-and-core-components.html">Criteria for Accreditation</a>, a set of standards that institutions must meet to receive and/or maintain accredited status. HLC’s Criteria for Accreditation reflect a set of <a href="/About-HLC/guiding-values.html">Guiding Values</a>.</p>
      <p class="basic">The accreditation process is based on a system of <a href="/Peer-Review/peer-reviewers.html">peer review</a>. Approximately 2,000 educators from institutions of higher education serve as HLC peer reviewers conducting accreditation evaluations for other institutions. They make recommendations to HLC’s decision-making bodies, which take final action on institutional evaluations and are made up of both peer reviewers and public members.</p>
      <h3 style="color: #000000; font-weight: 300; font-size: 30px; margin: 20px 0 10px 0;">Evaluation Process</h3>
      <p class="basic">HLC accreditation assures quality by verifying that an institution (1) meets threshold requirements and (2) is engaged in continuous improvement. In addition, all institutions are required to data annually in the <a href="/Accreditation/institutional-update.html">Institutional Update</a>, undergo annual monitoring of <a href="/Accreditation/indicators.html">financial and non-financial indicators</a>, and adhere to HLC policies and practices, including Assumed Practices and Obligations of Membership.</p>
      <h3 style="color: #000000; font-weight: 300; font-size: 30px; margin: 20px 0 10px 0;">Decision Making</h3>
      <p class="basic">HLC’s decision-making bodies evaluate and make decisions, called actions, on recommendations from peer review teams that review institutions for their compliance with HLC's Criteria for Accreditation and other requirements. The decision-making bodies are comprised of institutional representatives and public members. See <a href="/Accreditation/decision-making.html">Decision-Making Bodies and Processes</a> for more information. </p>
      <h3 style="color: #000000; font-weight: 300; font-size: 30px; margin: 20px 0 10px 0;">Public Information</h3>
      <p class="basic">HLC is committed to providing information to the public regarding accreditation decisions made regarding individual institutions.</p>
      <p class="basic">Actions that are taken by HLC regarding an institution’s accreditation status are disclosed to the public. In cases of reaffirming continued accreditation, placing an institution on or reviewing a sanction, or withdrawing accreditation, the Action Letter issued to the institution is made available for viewing on the institution’s Statement of Accreditation Status, found by searching the institution’s name through HLC’s online directory. Public Disclosure Notices are also issued and posted in the directory in cases of sanction, assigning or removing an institutional designation, resignation of accreditation or candidacy, institutional closing or withdrawal of accreditation by HLC. The PDN provides the public with the most applicable information from the posted Action Letter. HLC decision-making outcomes also are summarized on the HLC Institutional Actions page. </p>

      <p class="basic">HLC has a formal complaint process, consisting of an online complaint form on the HLC website, for faculty, students and other parties to submit information regarding a member institution’s potential non-compliance with HLC requirements. HLC does not accept complaints through mail, email or over the phone. As stated in <a href="/Policies/complaints-and-other-information-regarding-institutions.html">HLC policy</a>, the complaints process is designed to enable HLC to review, in a timely and fair manner, information that suggests potential substantive non-compliance with an institution’s ability to meet HLC requirements. </p>
